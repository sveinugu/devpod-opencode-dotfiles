# DevSpace Workspace Lifecycle

## Doctor

Run a read-only health checklist from the host:

```bash
devspace run-pipeline doctor
```

Behavior:

- exit `0`: all required checks pass
- exit `1`: one or more required checks failed
- exit `2`: invalid CLI usage

The v1 checklist includes Deployment/PVC presence, pod reachability, top-level bare-hub validity, managed directory existence, canonical `state/hub/main` and `tmp/hub/main` paths, `/home/vscode` symlink targets, and installed-branch reporting from `state/hub/etc/install.env` when present.

## In-pod managed repo/worktree commands

Use these in-pod commands for managed repo/worktree setup:

```bash
/workspaces/dotfiles/main/bin/clone-repo https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git
/workspaces/dotfiles/main/bin/new-worktree --repo hub feature/example
/workspaces/dotfiles/main/bin/new-worktree --repo <child-repo-name> feature/example
```

Managed checkouts get generated `.envrc` and `.envrc.local`. The managed `.envrc` exports `HUB_*`, `DYN_REPO_*`, and `DYN_WORKTREE_*`, sources `state/hub/etc/install.env` when present, then sources `.envrc.local`.

For quick navigation to the active install checkout, `.zshrc` includes `dd()`; it prints the destination and then changes directory.

## Repair

Run non-destructive structural recovery:

```bash
devspace run-pipeline repair
```

Behavior:

- recreates missing managed directories (`work/`, `repos/`, `state/`, `tmp/`)
- recreates canonical top-level paths (`state/hub/main`, `tmp/hub/main`)
- reattaches `main` only when `.bare` is valid and recognizable
- preserves valid non-`main` `/home/vscode` symlink targets
- resolves install source in this order: explicit `HUB_INSTALL_BRANCH`, then `state/hub/etc/install.env`, then `main`
- keeps `/workspaces/dotfiles/main` attached to `main` even when install source is non-`main`
- refuses when identity is ambiguous, `.bare` is invalid, or managed paths conflict by type

Inspect installed-branch state before repair:

```bash
cat /workspaces/dotfiles/state/hub/etc/install.env
```

`repair` is best-effort and non-destructive; it does not delete existing files or worktrees.

## Destroy

Run destructive reset:

```bash
devspace run-pipeline destroy
```

Behavior:

- deletes Deployment/pod
- deletes PVC
- does not preserve uncommitted work, runtime session data, or `/home/vscode` content on the deleted PVC

After `destroy`, run `devspace run-pipeline provision` to recreate from scratch.
